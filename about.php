            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                In 2016, seven students attending Mt. Sac community college had a group project for a web development
            class due that summer. Their task, was to build a fully functional e-commerce website that they would share with their fellow 
            classmates and the world wide web. When the final product was unveiled, the professor gave generous praise with A grades all around.
            A few of the students loved the project so much that they didn't want to end it, so they decided to actually look into the viability of starting 
            a coffee business based off the platform and code that they built for this fictitious business. Well, fiction became reality and Beanco was born
            the following spring.

            <h2>Mission</h2>
            <p>BeanCo was founded on the core principles of sustainability, acheiving unparralleled quality by sourcing only the most superb beans, 
            and catering to people of all walks of life. The founding members are strong believers in karma or the golden rule if you prefer; basically,
            the idea that being good to people and caring for the planet is not only the right thing to do, but rewards(not just financial) will come back full
            circle in all sorts of ways. So whether you're a plumber or a hedgefund manager, enjoy one of our cups of joe and revitalize your taste buds, as
            well as your soul. </p>
